# Your rule content

- You can @ files here
- You can use markdown but dont have to

# Bad - All routes in one file
@app.route('/users')
def users():
    pass

@app.route('/products')
def products():
    pass

# Good - Organize with blueprints
# users/routes.py
users_bp = Blueprint('users', __name__)

@users_bp.route('/')
def users():
    pass

# products/routes.py
products_bp = Blueprint('products', __name__)

@products_bp.route('/')
def products():
    pass

# In your app factory
app.register_blueprint(users_bp, url_prefix='/users')
app.register_blueprint(products_bp, url_prefix='/products')
