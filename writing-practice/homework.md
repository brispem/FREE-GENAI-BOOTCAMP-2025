# Homework Documentation: Writing Practice Application

## Original Assignment

### Business Goal
Create a learning exercise application for practicing written language translation, where:
- The app generates simple English sentences
- Students write translations in the target language
- The system evaluates the handwritten translations

### Technical Requirements
- Streamlit for the interface
- OCR capability (MangaOCR for Japanese, or Vision LLM for other languages)
- Image upload functionality

## Our Implementation

### Technology Choices
1. **Framework**: 
   - Chose Gradio instead of Streamlit for rapid prototyping
   - Gradio provided better built-in support for image handling

2. **Language Focus**:
   - Implemented Spanish instead of Japanese
   - This choice allowed us to use GPT-4o for both sentence generation and handwriting analysis

3. **Key Components**:
   - GPT-4o for English sentence generation
   - Image upload interface for handwritten Spanish translations
   - GPT-4o Vision capabilities for OCR and translation grading

### Application Flow
1. **Setup**:
   - User sees a clean interface with a "Generate Sentence" button
   - OpenAI API integration configured through environment variables

2. **Practice Flow**:
   - System generates a simple English sentence using GPT-4o
   - User writes the Spanish translation by hand
   - User uploads a photo/scan of their handwritten attempt
   - GPT-4o analyzes the handwriting and provides feedback on:
     - Transcription accuracy
     - Translation correctness
     - Handwriting clarity

3. **Technical Implementation**:
   - Used Python with Gradio for the web interface
   - Implemented proper error handling and logging
   - Structured the code with clear separation of concerns
   - Maintained configuration in separate files (.env, config.py)

### Key Files
- `app.py`: Main application logic and UI
- `config.py`: Configuration management
- `prompts.yaml`: System prompts for GPT-4o
- `.env`: Environment variables (API keys)

### Outcomes
1. **Successful Implementation**:
   - Created a functional prototype for language writing practice
   - Demonstrated effective use of AI for both generation and grading
   - Provided immediate feedback to users

2. **Technical Learning**:
   - Integrated modern AI capabilities (GPT-4o)
   - Handled multimodal inputs (text and images)
   - Managed API keys and configuration securely

3. **Improvements Over Original Spec**:
   - Used a more advanced AI model for better accuracy
   - Implemented detailed feedback system
   - Created a more interactive user experience

### Future Improvements
1. Add a clear button to reset the interface
2. Include example images for user guidance
3. Add a history of previous attempts
4. Enhance error handling messages
5. Add support for multiple languages
6. Implement user session management

## Conclusion
While we deviated from the original specification by using Gradio instead of Streamlit and Spanish instead of Japanese, our implementation successfully met the core business goal of providing a writing practice tool for language learners. The use of GPT-4o demonstrated how modern AI can be effectively used for both text generation and handwriting analysis in language learning applications.
