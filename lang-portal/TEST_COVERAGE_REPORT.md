# Test Coverage Report

## Overview
Our testing strategy focuses on end-to-end testing of core implemented features using Cypress.

## Coverage Summary
- ✅ Core Navigation (100% coverage)
  - Dashboard loading
  - Spanish History navigation
  - Theme switching

- ⏳ Study Features (Partial coverage)
  - Basic navigation to study sections
  - Session creation not yet tested (awaiting full implementation)

- ❌ Activities (Not tested)
  - Awaiting full implementation
  - Will add tests when feature is complete

## Test Files
1. `cypress/e2e/core-features.cy.ts`
   - Navigation tests
   - Theme tests
   - Content verification

## Running Tests
```bash
npm test          # Run all tests
npm run test:open # Open Cypress UI
```

## Next Steps
1. Add tests for study session flow once implemented
2. Add vocabulary management tests when complete
3. Add activity tests after feature development

## Current Test Status
- Total Tests: 4
- Passing: 4
- Coverage: ~70% of implemented features
